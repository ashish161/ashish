          ## SRE Pillars & Leadership

            - Defined foundational SRE pillars, including office hours, standardized tooling (Dynatrace, Grafana,
            Splunk, Tableau), and frameworks for reliability and observability.
            - Conducted maturity assessments to shape the technology roadmap and align application priorities.
            Observability
            - Designed Grafana-based dashboards for Prime Reporting, enabling visibility into the performance,
            health, and reliability of complex, distributed systems. Improved anomaly detection, bottleneck
            identification, and ability to take data driven decisions based on historical trends.
            - Developed a metrics dictionary to standardize and scale observability solutions across batch
            processing, volumes, and system health milestones.
            - Built a web-based RAG status dashboard for SLA-critical hedge fund client feeds, enhancing proactive
            monitoring and minimizing client-facing impacts for account managers.
          
          ## System Stability
            - Rationalized noisy alerts to prioritize actionable insights, reducing operational overhead.
            - Automated System Recovery (SR) and Disaster Recovery (DR) testing via reusable patterns in the
            Wolverinetool, ensuring consistent validation of critical workflows.
            - Optimized application reliability by reducing GC cycles, fine-tuning heaps, and automating the
            collection of CPU/heap/thread dumps for faster RCAs and incident resolution.
            - Conducted infrastructure reviews to identify capacity bottlenecks, optimize resource utilization, and
            reduce costs.
 
          ##  Automation
            - Built an Events Framework (Spring Boot, Kafka, Oracle DB) and a Metrics Collection Framework
            (Python, REST APIs, Control-M), ensuring cross-application observability and reusable integrations.
            - Automated SLA metric aggregation for CCR and enhanced AppDNa to streamline recurring tasks.
            - Delivered tools for critical SLA monitoring, providing holistic views across client feeds.
            - Modernization
            - Enabled proactive monitoring for cloud migration efforts by deploying Datadog dashboards and
            alerts.
            - Integrated Datadog with on-premise Geneos, consolidating monitoring for a unified production
            support view.
            - Advocated modern telemetry and APM practices, reducing noise and improving reliability insights.
            - Incident Management
            - Improved MTTR through automated runbooks and enhanced alerting mechanisms.
            - Delivered actionable insights via Tableau retrospectives, driving data-driven incident resolution and
            workflow optimization.

          Equities Transfer Pricing is a joint initiative between Investment Bank (IB) Treasury and the Securities
          Prime Brokerage & Financing (Equities and Fixed Income) Businesses. The primary objective of the
          project is to implement a systematic cash flow to internalize (net) long positions to cover short
          positions and apply appropriate economics on it (fee and rebate for the transaction ), this reduces the
          funding cost to treasury. This is the most important application in Prime Finance from regulatory and
          PnL perspective as it internalizes positions worth 700 Billion Dollars on a daily basis.
          
          - About 30% of my time was spent in liaising with senior management from both business and
          technology and ensuring the product development requirements including regulatory impact are

          - Worked as Tech Lead and PIC for Equities Transfer Pricing, leading a team of 7 software engineers
          based in the UK, Europe and India, this included assigning their daily tasks, assisting them on a

          - Managing teams that are based globally and coming from diverse backgrounds helped me develop
          as an empathetic and strategic leader
          - Used agile (scrum) principles in my teams to deliver highly performant and great quality code in a
          timely manner
          - Refactoring of existing code to support feature flag based configurations for EMEA and NA
          markets
